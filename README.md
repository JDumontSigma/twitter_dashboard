# Twitter Visualisation 
> A piece which takes advantage of websockets and JavaScript's canvas element to generate live content based on live tweets being sent through twitter. The ability to set up a new 'stream' using a custom hashtag of your choice

## Current State
> Meant for personal use and will only currently allow one unique stream to be run at one point, however potential expansion would be to look into generating a database run system with ability to run multiple 'streams' at once

### Next Steps
[ ]  Build Database based system
[ ]  Allow multiple streams
[ ]  Reskin and finalise layout
[ ]  Set up better hosting solution

### Technologies used
* Gulp
* Sass
* Webpack
* Node

* Socketio
* Twitte API
